# neuralStyleTF_automate

Needs a valid installation of the [neural-style-tf](https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf) package!


## Instructions

For now, the script requires changing paths and images names directly on the [main](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/neuralStyleTF_automate/blob/master/main.py). Once everything is in good shape, just run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Will try to make it more streamlined in the future if there's time for it.
